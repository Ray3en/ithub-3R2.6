This choice variety is slow to reproduce (though heavy blooming) and therefore always in short supply. We offer one bulb in a 7\" red foil cachepot.",

That`s a lot of flower power. The blooms are lightly ruffled in a distinctive shade of creamy chartreuse with deeper green throats. \"Yellow Star\" is an exceptionally late variety, but well worth the wait. We offer one bulb in a 7\" woven basket.",
